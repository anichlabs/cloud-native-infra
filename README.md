# Cloud-Native Infrastructure

This repository provides an open, modular, and portable cloud-native infrastructure stack.  
It is designed for cost-effective deployment on European cloud providers (e.g. Hetzner, Scaleway, OVH),  
while remaining fully portable to other providers if required.

## Vision

The project aims to deliver a production-grade reference implementation of Kubernetes-based infrastructure that is:

- High availability and scalable  
- Secure by default  
- Compliant with European GDPR and AI Act principles  
- Built only on open-source components, preferably European-led projects  
- Designed for research, machine learning, AI development, and medical workloads  

## Guiding Principles

- **Portability:** provider-agnostic modules, CNCF alignment  
- **Open Standards:** only open-source, transparent components  
- **European-first:** compliance with GDPR, AI Act, data residency awareness  
- **Security-first:** least privilege, encryption, scanning, and runtime detection  
- **GitOps:** declarative management with continuous reconciliation  
- **Modularity:** easily replace or extend components
